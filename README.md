# Pelops-Solver
it is a personal project, made for practice purposes and self improvement

It is a theme inspired program, inspired by the AI charecter Pelops II from Godzilla Singular Point
(I just like the charecter)

I will add an interrface later during development that will have some images or fanart, but it will
function as intended to help college students solve mathematical modeling problems/exercises

I am going to later update the README.MD as the project progresses, any feedback is welcome.
